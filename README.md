Eckmiller_2011: 
Infos: Total mass, gas mass, temperature, luminosity, metallicity
Hydrostatic mass plus some temperatures/metallicities are core-corrected temperature (remove cool core). Luminosity: 0.1-2.4 keV. should be scaled by 1/.62 to convert to 0.5-2.0 keV

Osmond_2004:
Infos: Metallicity, temperature, luminosity
0.5-2.0 keV, Temperature: remove cool cores.

Pratt_2009:
Infos: temperature, luminosity
T/L_1: include cores; T/L_2: exclude core regions. M500/R500 are estimated using Yx and should not be directly used.

Sun_2009:
Infos: temprature, total mass, gas mass, entropy
temperature: exclude core regions. Hydrostatic mass.

Chiu_2018:
Infos: gas mass, stellar mass, baryon mass
M* has no ICL. cold baryon fraction fc = M*/(M* + Micm)

Lagana_2013:
Infos: stellar mass, gas mass, total mass
total mass: HE (hydrostatic equilibrium) is assumed.
stellar mass: ICL is ignored

Gonzalez_2013: 
Infos: stellar mass, gas mass, total mass
total mass: rely on HE.
stellar mass: include ICL

Lovisari_2015:
Infos: total mass, gas mass, temperature, luminosity
total mass: hydrostatic mass
temperature: core-corrected
luminosity: 0.1-2.4 keV
