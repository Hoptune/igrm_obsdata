Lx:
Eckmiller_2011: Hydrostatic mass plus some temperatures/metallicities are core-corrected temperature. Luminosity: 0.1-2.4 keV. should be scaled by 1/.62 to convert to 0.5-2.0 keV
Osmond_2004: 0.5-2.0 keV
Pratt_2009: T/L_1: include cores; T/L_2: exclude core regions. M500/R500 are estimated using Yx and should not be directly used.
Sun_2009: temperature: exclude core regions. Hydrostatic mass.

Mass:
Lagana_2013: total mass: HE (hydrostatic equilibrium) is assumed.
Gonzalez_2013: total mass estimates still rely on HE.
